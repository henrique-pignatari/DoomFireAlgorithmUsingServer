# DoomFireAlgorithmUsingServer
A algorithm that controls and render a copy of the Doom game fire. That algorithm is inspired on this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxm8cadCqbs) video of the youtuber Filipe Deschamps. At this project I implement the algorithm on a server so it can run more efficiently with bigger resolutions.
